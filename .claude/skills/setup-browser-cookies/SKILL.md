## Preamble (run first)

```bash
# rstack preamble — session tracking, branch, repo mode, learnings
mkdir -p ~/.rstack/sessions
touch ~/.rstack/sessions/"$PPID"
find ~/.rstack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -exec rm {} + 2>/dev/null || true

_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"

source <(~/.claude/bin/rstack-repo-mode 2>/dev/null) || true
REPO_MODE=${REPO_MODE:-unknown}
echo "REPO_MODE: $REPO_MODE"

eval "$(~/.claude/bin/rstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || true
_LEARN_FILE="$HOME/.rstack/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl"
_LEARN_COUNT=0
[ -f "$_LEARN_FILE" ] && _LEARN_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$_LEARN_FILE" | tr -d ' ')
echo "LEARNINGS: $_LEARN_COUNT entries loaded"

_TEL_START=$(date +%s)
_SESSION_ID="$$-$(date +%s)"
```

If `REPO_MODE` is `solo`: you own everything. Fix issues proactively without asking.
If `REPO_MODE` is `collaborative`: flag via AskUserQuestion before fixing anything owned by others.
If `REPO_MODE` is `unknown`: treat as collaborative.

If learnings are loaded (`LEARNINGS > 0`): search for relevant ones before starting:
```bash
~/.claude/bin/rstack-learnings-search --limit 5 2>/dev/null || true
```


## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the user decides.

## Operational Feedback

Before reporting status, note discoveries worth logging:

```bash
~/.claude/bin/rstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":8,"source":"observed"}' 2>/dev/null || true
```

Only log genuine discoveries that would save 5+ minutes in a future session.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Telemetry (run last)

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
if [ "${_TEL:-off}" != "off" ]; then
  echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.rstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME` with the actual skill name, `OUTCOME` with success/error/abort.

## Plan Status Footer

When in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode, run:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/bin/rstack-review-read
\`\`\`

Write a `## RSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section to the plan file. If `NO_REVIEWS`, write a placeholder table showing CEO/Codex/Eng/Design review rows, all at 0 runs.

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN.**


# Setup Browser Cookies

Import logged-in sessions from your real Chromium browser into the headless browse session.

## CDP mode check

First, check if browse is already connected to the user's real browser:
```bash
$B status 2>/dev/null | grep -q "Mode: cdp" && echo "CDP_MODE=true" || echo "CDP_MODE=false"
```
If `CDP_MODE=true`: tell the user "Not needed — you're connected to your real browser via CDP. Your cookies and sessions are already available." and stop. No cookie import needed.

## How it works

1. Find the browse binary
2. Run `cookie-import-browser` to detect installed browsers and open the picker UI
3. User selects which cookie domains to import in their browser
4. Cookies are decrypted and loaded into the Playwright session

## Steps

### 1. Find the browse binary

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B=~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "gstack browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed:
   ```bash
   if ! command -v bun >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | BUN_VERSION=1.3.10 bash
   fi
   ```

### 2. Open the cookie picker

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser
```

This auto-detects installed Chromium browsers and opens
an interactive picker UI in your default browser where you can:
- Switch between installed browsers
- Search domains
- Click "+" to import a domain's cookies
- Click trash to remove imported cookies

Tell the user: **"Cookie picker opened — select the domains you want to import in your browser, then tell me when you're done."**

### 3. Direct import (alternative)

If the user specifies a domain directly (e.g., `/setup-browser-cookies github.com`), skip the UI:

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser comet --domain github.com
```

Replace `comet` with the appropriate browser if specified.

### 4. Verify

After the user confirms they're done:

```bash
$B cookies
```

Show the user a summary of imported cookies (domain counts).

## Notes

- On macOS, the first import per browser may trigger a Keychain dialog — click "Allow" / "Always Allow"
- On Linux, `v11` cookies may require `secret-tool`/libsecret access; `v10` cookies use Chromium's standard fallback key
- Cookie picker is served on the same port as the browse server (no extra process)
- Only domain names and cookie counts are shown in the UI — no cookie values are exposed
- The browse session persists cookies between commands, so imported cookies work immediately
