## Preamble (run first)

```bash
# rstack preamble — session tracking, branch, repo mode, learnings
mkdir -p ~/.rstack/sessions
touch ~/.rstack/sessions/"$PPID"
find ~/.rstack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -exec rm {} + 2>/dev/null || true

_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"

source <(~/.claude/bin/rstack-repo-mode 2>/dev/null) || true
REPO_MODE=${REPO_MODE:-unknown}
echo "REPO_MODE: $REPO_MODE"

eval "$(~/.claude/bin/rstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || true
_LEARN_FILE="$HOME/.rstack/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl"
_LEARN_COUNT=0
[ -f "$_LEARN_FILE" ] && _LEARN_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$_LEARN_FILE" | tr -d ' ')
echo "LEARNINGS: $_LEARN_COUNT entries loaded"

_TEL_START=$(date +%s)
_SESSION_ID="$$-$(date +%s)"
```

If `REPO_MODE` is `solo`: you own everything. Fix issues proactively without asking.
If `REPO_MODE` is `collaborative`: flag via AskUserQuestion before fixing anything owned by others.
If `REPO_MODE` is `unknown`: treat as collaborative.

If learnings are loaded (`LEARNINGS > 0`): search for relevant ones before starting:
```bash
~/.claude/bin/rstack-learnings-search --limit 5 2>/dev/null || true
```
