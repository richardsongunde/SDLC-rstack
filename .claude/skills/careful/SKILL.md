  Safety guardrails for destructive commands. Warns before rm -rf, DROP TABLE,
  force-push, git reset --hard, kubectl delete, and similar destructive operations.
  User can override each warning. Use when touching prod, debugging live systems,
  or working in a shared environment. Use when asked to "be careful", "safety mode",
  "prod mode", or "careful mode". (rstack)

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
# rstack preamble — session tracking, branch, repo mode, learnings
mkdir -p ~/.rstack/sessions
touch ~/.rstack/sessions/"$PPID"
find ~/.rstack/sessions -mmin +120 -type f -exec rm {} + 2>/dev/null || true

_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"

source <(~/.claude/bin/rstack-repo-mode 2>/dev/null) || true
REPO_MODE=${REPO_MODE:-unknown}
echo "REPO_MODE: $REPO_MODE"

eval "$(~/.claude/bin/rstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || true
_LEARN_FILE="$HOME/.rstack/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl"
_LEARN_COUNT=0
[ -f "$_LEARN_FILE" ] && _LEARN_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$_LEARN_FILE" | tr -d ' ')
echo "LEARNINGS: $_LEARN_COUNT entries loaded"

_TEL_START=$(date +%s)
_SESSION_ID="$$-$(date +%s)"
```

If `REPO_MODE` is `solo`: you own everything. Fix issues proactively without asking.
If `REPO_MODE` is `collaborative`: flag via AskUserQuestion before fixing anything owned by others.
If `REPO_MODE` is `unknown`: treat as collaborative.

If learnings are loaded (`LEARNINGS > 0`): search for relevant ones before starting:
```bash
~/.claude/bin/rstack-learnings-search --limit 5 2>/dev/null || true
```

# /careful — Destructive Command Guardrails

Safety mode is now **active**. Every bash command will be checked for destructive
patterns before running. If a destructive command is detected, you'll be warned
and can choose to proceed or cancel.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.rstack/analytics
echo '{"skill":"careful","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.rstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## What's protected

| Pattern | Example | Risk |
|---------|---------|------|
| `rm -rf` / `rm -r` / `rm --recursive` | `rm -rf /var/data` | Recursive delete |
| `DROP TABLE` / `DROP DATABASE` | `DROP TABLE users;` | Data loss |
| `TRUNCATE` | `TRUNCATE orders;` | Data loss |
| `git push --force` / `-f` | `git push -f origin main` | History rewrite |
| `git reset --hard` | `git reset --hard HEAD~3` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `git checkout .` / `git restore .` | `git checkout .` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `kubectl delete` | `kubectl delete pod` | Production impact |
| `docker rm -f` / `docker system prune` | `docker system prune -a` | Container/image loss |

## Safe exceptions

These patterns are allowed without warning:
- `rm -rf node_modules` / `.next` / `dist` / `__pycache__` / `.cache` / `build` / `.turbo` / `coverage`

## How it works

The hook reads the command from the tool input JSON, checks it against the
patterns above, and returns `permissionDecision: "ask"` with a warning message
if a match is found. You can always override the warning and proceed.

To deactivate, end the conversation or start a new one. Hooks are session-scoped.
## Completion Protocol

STATUS: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT

DONE: workflow complete, deliverable produced.
DONE_WITH_CONCERNS: complete but with issues the user should review.
BLOCKED: state exactly what prevents completion.
NEEDS_CONTEXT: ask ONE specific question to unblock.
