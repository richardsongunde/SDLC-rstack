# RStack on any framework (custom integration)

<!-- owner: RStack developed by Richardson Gunde -->

RStack's host coupling is intentionally thin. Any agent framework can
integrate at one of two levels.

## Level 1 — reuse the Node bridge (recommended)

Shell out to the bridge once per tool call, exactly like the Operator adapter
does:

```bash
RSTACK_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/project \
  npx tsx node_modules/rstack-agents/bin/rstack-operator-bridge.ts <tool_name> '<json-params>'
```

- stdout: the tool's result object as JSON
- stderr + exit 1: errors
- Tools: `sdlc_start`, `sdlc_plan`, `sdlc_build_next`, `sdlc_validate`,
  `sdlc_approve`, `sdlc_status`, `sdlc_trace`, `sdlc_rollback`, and more —
  run with no arguments to list them.

This gives you the full governed harness (stages, contracts, evidence,
checkpoints, approvals, memory) with zero reimplementation.

## Level 2 — speak the state contract directly

All state lives under `.rstack/runs/<run_id>/`:

| Artifact | Contract |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | `run_id`, `goal`, `mode`, `status`, timestamps |
| `tasks.json` | Task list with `stage_artifacts[].stage_id` (canonical stages) |
| `tasks/<task_id>/builder.json` | Builder contract: `task_id`, `status`, `summary`, `files_modified`, `tests_run`, `risks`, `next_steps`, `memory_summary`, `stage_summaries` |
| `tasks/<task_id>/validation.json` | Validator report: `checks[]`, `status`, `issues[]` |
| `events.jsonl` | Append-only events (`task_started`, `task_validated`, `stage_completed`, `cost_recorded`, …) with ISO `ts` |
| `evidence.jsonl` | Evidence records: `task_id`, `kind`, `status`, `evidence` |
| `approvals.json` | Human approval gates |
| `metrics.json` | `stage_elapsed_ms`, `stage_status`, cumulative totals |

Anything that writes these contracts shows up in the Business Hub with full
timelines, stage durations, and traceability — the dashboard derives
everything from this data.

## The 15 canonical stages

`00-environment` → `01-transcript` → `02-requirements` → `03-documentation` →
`04-planning` → `05-jira` → `06-architecture` → `07-code` → `08-testing` →
`09-deployment` → `10-summary` (+ optional `11-feedback-loop`,
`12-security-threat-model`, `13-compliance-checker`, `14-cost-estimation`).

Stage ids in events and artifacts must be canonical — validate against
`src/core/harness/stages.js`.
