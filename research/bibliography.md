# RStack Research Bibliography

This bibliography records the sources used to ground the RStack SDLC research narrative. It separates standards, prior-art implementations, empirical productivity evidence, security references, and RStack primary-source artifacts so the paper can cite claims without reconstructing context later.

## Standards and governance references

### NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- **Reference:** National Institute of Standards and Technology, *AI Risk Management Framework*.
- **URL:** https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework
- **Why it matters to RStack:** RStack's governance model can map Business Hub observability, approvals, validation contracts, and future governance packs to AI risk management practices.
- **RStack connection:** Supports roadmap issues for governance packs, RStack Spec v1alpha1, cross-harness validation, and claims discipline.

### NIST SP 800-218 Secure Software Development Framework

- **Why it matters to RStack:** SSDF states that secure software practices must be added explicitly to SDLC models. RStack's value proposition is exactly this: make approvals, evidence, validator contracts, guardrails, and release readiness explicit in AI-assisted delivery.
- **RStack connection:** Supports evidence, validator contracts, untrusted PR gates, and release-readiness checks.

### ISO/IEC 42001:2023 AI management systems

- **URL:** https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/
- **Why it matters to RStack:** Provides regulatory motivation for traceability, transparency, risk management, and documented oversight in AI workflows.

## Secure supply-chain and attestation references

### SLSA Provenance
- **Reference:** Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts, *Provenance specification*.
- **URL:** https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/provenance
- **Why it matters to RStack:** RStack's future attestation envelope should record where, when, and how an agent-produced artifact was created and validated.
- **RStack connection:** Supports future `rstack-agents attest` and `verify-attestations` work.

### DSSE specification
- **Reference:** Secure Systems Lab, *DSSE: Dead Simple Signing Envelope*.
- **URL:** https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse
- **Why it matters to RStack:** Provides an envelope pattern for signing structured payloads. RStack can adapt this pattern for builder, validator, and release-readiness evidence.
- **RStack connection:** Supports attestation roadmap and paper claims about tamper-evident evidence.

### Sigstore documentation
- **Reference:** Sigstore documentation.
- **URL:** https://docs.sigstore.dev/
- **Why it matters to RStack:** Provides a practical signing/provenance ecosystem that can inform enterprise-mode evidence verification.
- **RStack connection:** Supports optional signed attestation mode beyond local unsigned development mode.

## AI security references

### OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications
- **Reference:** OWASP Foundation, *Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications*.
- **URL:** https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/
- **Why it matters to RStack:** AI-assisted SDLC systems are exposed to prompt injection, insecure output handling, excessive agency, sensitive information disclosure, and supply-chain risks.
- **RStack connection:** Supports validator restrictions, untrusted PR gates, protected actions, and cross-harness review.

## AI-SDLC prior art

### Augment Code AI SDLC Framework reference architecture
- **Reference:** Augment Code, *AI SDLC Framework: A CTO Reference Architecture*.
- **URL:** https://www.augmentcode.com/guides/ai-sdlc-framework-reference-architecture
- **Verified page title during research:** `AI SDLC Framework: A CTO Reference Architecture | Augment Code`
- **Verified page description during research:** `See how a five-layer AI SDLC framework structures agents, orchestration, observability, and governance so CTOs can scale AI-assisted delivery.`
- **Why it matters to RStack:** Confirms the market pattern that AI-SDLC platforms need layered agents, orchestration, observability, and governance.
- **RStack connection:** RStack already implements a business-facing version through profiles, Business Hub, contracts, approvals, evidence, and adapters.

### ai-sdlc-framework/ai-sdlc
- **Reference:** `ai-sdlc-framework/ai-sdlc`, public GitHub repository.
- **URL:** https://github.com/ai-sdlc-framework/ai-sdlc
- **Observed repo description:** `Declarative governance framework for AI-augmented software development lifecycles`
- **Observed license:** Apache-2.0
- **Observed comparison snapshot:** 3,819 tracked files, strong formal spec/RFC/gate orientation, 38 workflow files, and extensive TypeScript implementation.
- **Why it matters to RStack:** Provides prior-art patterns worth adapting: Decision Engine, Definition-of-Ready gates, declarative resources, cross-harness review, attestations, drift detection, and untrusted PR gates.
- **RStack connection:** RStack should copy patterns, not exact code, preserving its simpler one-package Business Hub product direction.

## Productivity and delivery research

### METR experienced open-source developer productivity study
- **Reference:** METR, *Measuring the Impact of Early-2025 AI on Experienced Open-Source Developer Productivity*.
- **URL:** https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/
- **Verified page description during research:** `We conduct a randomized controlled trial to understand how early-2025 AI tools affect the productivity of experienced open-source developers working on their own repositories. Surprisingly, we find that when developers use AI tools, they take 19% longer...`
- **Why it matters to RStack:** The study is a caution against assuming AI coding tools automatically improve productivity in mature codebases. RStack's claim must be that governance and structure reduce ambiguity and rework, not that AI alone guarantees speed.
- **RStack connection:** Supports the paper problem statement and claims discipline.

### Google DORA 2024 report
- **Reference:** Google Cloud DORA, *Accelerate State of DevOps Report 2024*.
- **URL:** https://dora.dev/research/2024/
- **Verified page description during research:** `DORA is a long running research program that seeks to understand the capabilities that drive software delivery and operations performance.`
- **Why it matters to RStack:** Provides delivery-performance and operational-excellence context for measuring AI-SDLC outcomes.
- **RStack connection:** Supports metrics such as cycle time, validation pass rate, deployment confidence, and reliability.

### Stack Overflow Developer Survey AI section
- **Reference:** Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024, AI section.
- **URL:** https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai
- **Why it matters to RStack:** Provides broader developer sentiment and adoption context for AI tools.
- **RStack connection:** Supports background section on trust gaps and need for validation/observability.
